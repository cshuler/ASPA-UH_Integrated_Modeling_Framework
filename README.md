A framework for, and a case study of a small scale, vertically integrated, collaborative groundwater modeling process that merges the fields of data-science and hydrology. This modeling framework applies an open-source, cloud-based, and process oriented paradigm to make modeling more accessible, transparent, reproducible, and stakeholder driven. We refer to this framework as vertically integrated because it includes a diverse chain of modular components extending from the direct collection and processing of basic hydrologic parameters, through to the development of a dynamic regional groundwater model.

## Getting Started  
This framework provides data, code, and documentation for a reseach scale hydrological modeling project. In genral, input data folders are kept separate from results (output data) folders, and code used to generate the outputs is developed within Jupyter Notebooks. Thus, when exploring this repository, all models and data processing routines can be found by searching for **.ipynb** files. If you are new to GitHub also consider exploring [This Website](https://integratedmodelingframework.weebly.com/) to learn more about what we are doing here.

The framework has four descrete components: 

#### 1: ASPA-UH_Wx_Sub-REPO contains data and code for processing and QA/QC-ing raw weather station data

[Download Processed Weather Station Data (click "view raw")](ASPA-UH_Wx_REPO/workspace/QA_All_merged.csv)

#### 2: ASPA-UH_Stream_Sub-REPO contains data and code for processing, QA/QC-ing, and automatically developing and updating rating curves from raw streamflow data

[Download Processed Streamflow Data](ASPA-UH_Stream_REPO/workspace)

#### 3: ASPA-UH-SWB2_REPO contains the needed data and code to run the Tutuila SWB2 water budget model

[See Maps of Recharge and other Water Budget Components](ASPA-UH-SWB2_REPO/output/Figures)

#### 4: ASPA-UH-Flopy_REPO contains files and code to run MODFLOW based groundwater models using the data generated within other components of this framework

### How it all fits together

Schematic of data and modeling workflow for the ASPA-UH-WRRC collaborative modeling framework. The SWB2 model is a water budget model originally developed by the USGS used to produce spatially distributed groundwater recharge data, and FloPy is a Python based MODFLOW groundwater model compiler used to predict groundwater heads and salinities on a regional scale.  Datasets or geospatial layer components are shown in quadrilaterals, code-based processes are contained in ovals, and external model executables are contained in triangles, which are themselves within ovals since they are run as Python sub-processes. All components, meaning all raw data, all modelign code, all model executables, and the most recent versions of results are included in this repository.
