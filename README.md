A framework for, and a case study of a small scale, vertically integrated, collaborative groundwater modeling process that takes advantage of recent advancements in cloud-computing and open-source modeling tools. We refer to this framework as vertically integrated because it includes a diverse chain of modular components extending from the direct collection and processing of basic hydrologic parameters, through to the development of a dynamic regional groundwater model.
