# ASPA-UH_Integrated_Modeling_Framework

A framework for, and a case study of a small scale, vertically integrated, collaborative groundwater modeling process that merges the fields of data-science and hydrology. This modeling framework applies an open-source, cloud-based, and process oriented paradigm to make modeling more accessible, transparent, reproducible, and stakeholder driven.


We refer to this framework as vertically integrated because it includes a diverse chain of modular components extending from the direct collection and processing of basic hydrologic parameters, through to the development of a dynamic regional groundwater model.

The framework has four descrete components: 

#### 1: ASPA-UH_Wx_Sub-REPO contains data and code for processing and QA/Qc-ing raw weather station data

[Download Processed Weather Station Data (click "view raw")](ASPA-UH_Wx_REPO/workspace/QA_All_merged.csv)

#### 2: ASPA-UH_Stream_Sub-REPO contains data and code for processing, QA/Qc-ing, and automatically developing and updating rating curves from raw streamflow data

[Download Processed Streamflow Data](ASPA-UH_Stream_REPO/workspace)

#### 3: ASPA-UH-SWB2_REPO contains the needed data and code to run the Tutuila SWB2 water budget model

[See Maps of Recharge and other Water Budget Components](ASPA-UH-SWB2_REPO/output/Figures)

#### 4: ASPA-UH-Flopy_REPO contains files and code to run MODFLOW based groundwater models using the data generated within other components of this framework

Schematic of data and modeling workflow for the ASPA-UH-WRRC collaborative modeling framework. Datasets or geospatial layer components are shown in quadrilaterals, code-based processes are contained in ovals, and external model executables are contained in triangles, which are themselves within ovals since they are run as Python sub-processes.
