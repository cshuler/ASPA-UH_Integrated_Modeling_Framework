Flow measurements: 

When new flow measurements are taken. Please open the file "Flow_measurements.csv" and record the following with the exact same spellings and fomats as the existing data Site name, Date and Time	Flow in cubic meters per second (m3ps), and the height of the staff gauge at the time of measurement. 

Save the file and close. 




Elevation corrections. 

If the elevation of the instrument changes, this needs to be documented so that a correction can be made. The distance of the sensor below the datum line (see Docs folder for explanations of datum locations) needs to stay consistent or else the calculated flow will change. 

If a shift has occured, either intentionally or from natural movement of objects the datum line should be made (by putting string across the two anchor points) and the distance from the datum line to the sensor water intake should be recorded.  This can be accomplished by measuring the distance to the water and adding the height of water recorded by the pressure transducer at that point in time. 

When a new distance to one of the sensors is found please note this change by adding the following information to the "Instrument_elevations_corrections.xlsx" spreadsheet. The information should be added to both the "Instrument_elevations_correctio" and the "(Site name)" sheets. 

Add the following info to the new row: 
Start  = this is when the sensor moved
Site - The name of the site, exactly as spelled in other instances. 
Sensor_dist_below_datum = the distance in m between the sensor intake and the datum line
Notes =  please add any notes here

Add the following to whatever row had the last data for the particular station: 
End = This will be essentially 15 minutes before the start time when the sensor moved

Remember to add the same data to both the "Instrument_elevations_correctio" and the "(Site name)" sheets.
