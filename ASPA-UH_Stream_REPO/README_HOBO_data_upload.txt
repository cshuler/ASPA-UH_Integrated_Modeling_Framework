Note on pre-precessing .hobo files into csvs


File naming convention

- The key for naming files is that they need to have the first word as the site name capitalized, with either a dash (-) or underscore ( _ ) following the name. 
- The current options are: 'Fagaalu', 'Leone', 'Fagasa', 'Afono', 'Nuuuli', 'Vaipito','Malota', 'Fagaitua'


HOBO files need to be processed into .csv files.

- This can be done with the bulk file export tool in the "tools" menu on the hoboware program.
- Note that the export tool has some parameters that can be changed in the File -> Preferences menu.
- For formatting you can look at an existing .csv file in the "Raw_streamflow_csv" directory of this repository and modifying the hoboware parameters to match the columns exactly.
