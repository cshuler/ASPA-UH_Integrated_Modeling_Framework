#  UH-ASPA monitoring well data component

This framework component is used to store raw monitroing well data and to process this data into a form that can be directly used for water level observations in the groundwater modeling component. 

This component is in an embrionic state, as there are only three test wells currently monitoried. However we plan to expand monitoring well capacity greatly in the future.
