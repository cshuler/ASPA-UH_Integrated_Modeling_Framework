A note on environments

The SWB2 model is written using functionality of the ARCPY module which requires using the ArcPro service pack. This requires being run from the licenced environment in which arc pro is installed. 

On my computer jupyter notebooks need to be run by opening an arcgis command prompt, navagating to the appropriate drive letter (E:) then using the command > ipython notebook to start the jupyter instance.
